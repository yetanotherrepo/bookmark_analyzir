# Bookmark Analyzer

This script analyzes your Google Chrome bookmarks, categorizes them, and generates a summary for each bookmark. It also provides an AI-generated description of the person who collected the bookmarks. The output is an HTML file styled with the Bootstrap framework.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Beautiful Soup 4
- Requests
- OpenAI

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests openai
```

## Setup

1. Export your Google Chrome bookmarks as an HTML file. You can follow [these instructions](https://www.wikihow.com/Export-Bookmarks-from-Chrome) to export your bookmarks.
2. Save the exported bookmarks HTML file as `bookmarks.html` in the same directory as the script.
3. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Replace `your_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key:

    On Linux or macOS:

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```

    On Windows (using Command Prompt):

    ```cmd
    set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```

    On Windows (using PowerShell):

    ```powershell
    $env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_api_key"
    ```

## Running the Script

After completing the setup, run the script in the terminal or command prompt with the following command:

```bash
python analyze_bookmarks.py
```

The script will generate an output file called `analyzed_bookmarks.html`, which will display the categorized bookmarks with their summaries and the AI-generated characteristics of the person who collected the bookmarks, all styled using the Bootstrap framework.
